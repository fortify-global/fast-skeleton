# Architecture
- Use FastAPI with 12-factor and SOLID.
- Centralized error model: {code, key, message, detail}. Always return JSON via handlers.
- Log with `from app import logger`. 
- This is a medium size application
- Do not over optimize.
- We do not use plural names. 

# Error handling
- Prefer raising AppException and other exception which extend or inherit AppException.
- Database/ThirdParty/Unexpected â†’ include traceback in details; return proper HTTP.

# API
- Versioned routes under /api/v1, /api/v2.
- Use Pydantic models for I/O.

# Code style
- Python 3.12, type hints, black/ruff compatible.
- F-strings for formatting in logging also 

# DB

# Tests

# Docker
- Working directory is fortify
